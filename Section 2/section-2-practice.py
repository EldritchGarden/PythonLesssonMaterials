"""
This weeks practice is working with variables.
There is 3 parts, the first part you will fill in the blanks to add two numbers.
The second part you will create a variable containing a string, then print it.
For the third part you will create variables for two numbers, then divide them to get the result.

Add your code under the respective comments

We will discuss this practice next class

# fill in the blanks to add two numbers
num_one =
num_two =

sum = num_one + num_two
print(f"Sum is {sum}")

# create a variable containing a string here, and print it


# create variables for two numbers, 12 and 5, then divide them
# print the result
